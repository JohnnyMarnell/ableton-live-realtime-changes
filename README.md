_"f*ck it we'll do Live live"_

Pretty pleased with how this quick hack turned out! Already allowing me to experiment
and prototype faster with hacking Ableton Live to do things like automated twerkflows.

Recently learned Ableton Live Set `.als` files are merely G-Zipped XML
(thanks Ableton, you kind geniuses, you).

Uses node [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar?tab=readme-ov-file#chokidar--)
to watch for file system updates, gunzip, and diff them.
